# Medication



Application for personal management of taking medication.
The application provides the user with a reminder to take medication, and manages the medication inventory so that there will never be a situation where a user needs the medication and it is not in their possession, because they forgot to buy another pack.
For the client side I used React, my favorite of the JavaScript libraries. In the development of the application, special attention is paid to clean code. What makes this project unique is the rich use of the formik, Mui and Prime React libraries, in order to achieve a well-built, pleasant and user-friendly application.
server side - The project was written in the .net environment, with c#. In terms of architecture, there is a division into separate layers for controllers, services and a repo layer that deals with all access to the database (written in SQL). I used Microsoft's EntityFramework. The system is monitored with loggers, so no bug can slip into nowhere.
Also on the server side, clean code is strictly adhered to.
During the work on the project I used GitHub to manage the different versions.

Good health to all.
